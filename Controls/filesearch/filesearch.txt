File Search
-----------
Allows you to search for files in any drive or folder e.g.

FS1.SearchFile list1, "x:\windows\system", "*.*", label1
FS1.SearchFile list1, "c:\", "*.txt;*.doc", label1

- list1 is the list where the files will be returned
- c:\ and x:\windows\system is the folder or drive that will be searched
- *.* and *.txt;*.doc is the filter you can also specify a file e.g. letter.txt
- label1 is the label whose caption property will be changed to show what folder
  is currently being searched.  You could also use the form or any control that
  has a caption property

It is recommended that you disable the form before the search then enable it
because the search cannot be interupted e.g.

Me.Enabled = False
FS1.SearchFile list1, "c:\docs", "letter.doc", label1
Me.Enabled = True
